## Main contribution
●	PTBGRP integrated the higher-level biological information with the lower-level topological features, which provided a novel insight to improve the prediction of phage-host interactions. 

●	PTBGRP constructed a novel microbial heterogeneous interaction network

●	Extensive ablation and comparison experiments demonstrated the excellent of the presented model.

●	Case studies of three pathogenic bacteria supposed the predictive power of PTBGRP.
